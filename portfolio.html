            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hello everyone, I'm Navya Sree, currently in my final year of Computer Science Engineering at Vignan's University. My journey in the field of technology has been nothing short of exhilarating. From coding my first program to exploring the latest advancements in AI and machine learning, I've always been driven by a deep curiosity and passion for tech. This passion has led me to constantly seek out new challenges and learning opportunities, which have shaped me into a well-rounded individual in the field.</p>
            <p>My academic journey has equipped me with a strong foundation in programming, software development, and other core areas of computer science. But what excites me the most is the ever-changing landscape of technology, where there's always something new to learn and explore. I have had an amazing experience in Digital Marketing Internship by Pulavarthi Group ,which is based in US. It really helped me in gaining a good view in the field of Digital Marketing.</p>
            <p>Outside the world of technology, I have a creative side that I cherish. I love spending my time resourcefully, engaging in sports. These activities allow me to express my creativity, think outside the box, and bring a sense of balance to my life. Whether it’s badminton, tennis or indoor games, these help me relax and recharge, providing a fresh outlook when I return to my technical work. This combination of technical expertise and creative expression makes me adaptable and innovative, qualities that I believe are essential in today’s dynamic world. I'm always eager to learn, grow, and contribute positively, and I look forward to the opportunities that lie ahead.</p>
            <p>Thank you!</p>
